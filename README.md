## Why CC BY? Why Open Source?
We are builders and rely on the ecosystem of engineers, builders and programmers that create open source software and tools. We want to encourage others to build with this mindset, in public, and aligned with a vision of an "Open Metaverse". We can do this by sharing our source code, source assets, building on the web, building together, and documenting our work in public using tools like Githib.
